# iwf_data_scraping
Code from a personal project to scrape results from the IWF website and perform analysis of international weightlifting results. I wanted to explore predicting the success of a lift given the previous attempts and the history. This project is unfinished and should be complete later.

For anyone interested in accessing the iwf results data, run the scrape_data.R file.
